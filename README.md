---

- Folders images/, XD/ is results data imgs, there are 1000 training results.
- File Gan.ipynb is simple image training GAN model
- File project.ipynb is simple sound traing GAN model
- Slide on https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JEhvYg8xsY-ygPEl9hqXzznVUNaJL-1-M3EQsOaapFs/edit#slide=id.p

**But. The sound transform is not good for training data, because the fft has some noise to influence normalization.**
